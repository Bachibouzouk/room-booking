#done PF
need to check if the email address is a mcgill one before I can accept the reservation (maybe send a check email)

#done (PF) in check_things.py it is fairly easy :)
need to be able to find all the booking made by one user

#done PF
need to be able to "hard book" any room and it should send a email to all users who had soft reservations

#done PF
need to find an available room for the time at which the user requests

#done PF for capacity and date
need to find a room depending on crossed field (room size, timeslots, etc...)

#done PF
need to create a log file of all booking made

#done PF
need to be able to update the periods where the rooms are hard booked from a routine (ie reading the file generated from banner with the latest changes)

#done Oulin
need to merge bookings if a user book a timeslot which is in the neighbouring of one of its previous booking

in case of HB over SB, if there is a conflict over, say the last 30 min of a booking, should we cancel the whole timeslot? I think we shouldn't

if a (hard) booking is made from a certain hour to another hour which doesn't match our timeslots, does that work? I think it should

#implemented PF
if soft booking is erased by HB, then send a notification email.

#implemented PF
A user should be able to cancel their booking (send and email with a link they need to click)

# done (oulin) - the constructor of SelectDateTime doesn't initialize the values, but the initial values are changed in views.py
need to be able to tell the constructor of the SelectDateTime class which default values the combo boxes for the time and date should take

#done PF
need to flush the bookings that are older than the current time

need to make the booking of past time impossible (not so important)

#(in the template when we have the information)
need to make the display of the room with their capacity and location in the room_display section (we might want to discuss that)

#On Going PF
need to convert the timesheet given by the registrar's office into our DB

#maybe not so important or DB takes care of that
need to know what to do when two people book the room at the SAME time (and how to simulate that....)

#ask mcgill it
how can we send the emails without using our personal accounts

Make things pretty css

#django tutorial
two types of user (special for HB)


If email not the right format (i.e. first.last@mcgill.ca), notify failure. Similarly, if email absent, notify failure instead of crashing.
Give option to modify (reduce) a booking time slots

#there is a fonction 'flush_past_bookings' that can be used for that
Past bookings (before current date) needs to be removed

#go back to view and notify
If email not the right format (i.e. first.last@mcgill.ca), notify failure


Give option to modify (reduce) a booking time slots

#ask the registar
what is the maximum duration for a booking's timeslot

create a view
login through link to manage all bookings

# PF wrote a test for that
forbid one user to book multiple rooms at same time

not have the tick option for HB for simple users

view and template
when ticking a box with timeslots adjacent to the same booking, tick everything

search options:

you can't search if you don't provide at least the date

search by date only and it shows all rooms with their availabilty on that date in a list style like McGill library

search by date and timeslots and it will give you the rooms list that are available

you can filter the later by room capacity as well

you should be able to filter by building

(need to check that with registrar if they have that info in their DB)
search with features available in the room 

****HB user

search by user (with their email)
