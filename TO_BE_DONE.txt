#done PF
need to check if the email address is a mcgill one before I can accept the reservation (maybe send a check email)

#done (PF) in check_things.py it is fairly easy :)
need to be able to find all the booking made by one user

#done PF
need to be able to "hard book" any room and it should send a email to all users who had soft reservations

#done PF
need to find an available room for the time at which the user requests

#done PF for capacity and date
need to find a room depending on crossed field (room size, timeslots, etc...)

#done PF
need to create a log file of all booking made

#Almost done
need to be able to update the periods where the rooms are hard booked from a routine (ie reading the file generated from banner with the latest changes)

need to merge bookings if a user book a timeslot which is in the neighbouring of one of its previous booking

in case of HB over SB, if there is a conflict over, say the last 30 min of a booking, should we cancel the whole timeslot? I think we shouldn't

if a (hard) booking is made from a certain hour to another hour which doesn't match our timeslots, does that work? I think it should

if soft booking is erased by HB, then send a notification email.

#almost done
A user should be able to cancel their booking (send and email with a link they need to click)

# done (oulin) - the constructor of SelectDateTime doesn't initialize the values, but the initial values are changed in views.py
need to be able to tell the constructor of the SelectDateTime class which default values the combo boxes for the time and date should take

need to flush the bookings that are older than the current time

need to make the booking of past time impossible (not so important)

need to make the display of the room with their capacity and location in the room_display section (we might want to discuss that)

need to convert the timesheet given by the registrar's office into our DB

need to know what to do when two people book the room at the SAME time (and how to simulate that....)

how can we send the emails without using our personal accounts

Make things pretty css

two types of user (special for HB)

If email not the right format (i.e. first.last@mcgill.ca), notify failure

Give option to modify (reduce) a booking time slots
