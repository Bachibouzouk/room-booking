*** How can we send emails without using our emails addresses?

The softbooking system needs to send email to the user to modify reservations.
The code has been tested using mailhost.mcgill.ca @physics.mcgill.ca and it worked, but in the future it might be better to
have something like no-reply-softbooking@mcgill.ca or equivalent.

-> touch point with developper


*** How can we get the information between hard booking and us flowing (use files of the same format as the .csv produced for SSMU students)
IT is going to look into it, should be possible


*** How can we get information about the rooms to populate our DB

seat size, room attributes, oracle
