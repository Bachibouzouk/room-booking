#done PF
need to check if the email address is a mcgill one before I can accept the reservation (maybe send a check email)

#done (PF) in check_things.py it is fairly easy :)
need to be able to find all the booking made by one user

#done PF
need to be able to "hard book" any room and it should send a email to all users who had soft reservations

#done PF
need to find an available room for the time at which the user requests

#done PF for capacity and date
need to find a room depending on crossed field (room size, timeslots, etc...)

#done PF
need to create a log file of all booking made

need to be able to update the periods where the rooms are hard booked from a routine (ie reading the file generated from banner with the latest changes)

need to merge bookings if a user book a timeslot which is in the neighbouring of one of its previous booking

if there is a conflict over, say the last 30 min of a booking, should we cancel the whole timeslot? I think we shouldn't

if a (hard) booking is made from a certain hour to another hour which doesn't match our timeslots, does that work? I think it should
