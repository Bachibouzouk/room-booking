need to check if the email address is a mcgill one before I can accept the reservation (maybe send a check email)

#done in check_things.py it is fairly easy :)
need to be able to find all the booking made by one user

need to be able to "hard book" any room and it should send a email to all users who had soft reservations

need to find an available room for the time at which the user requests

need to find a room depending on crossed field (room size, timeslots, etc...)

need to create a log file of all booking made

need to be able to update the periods where the rooms are hard booked
