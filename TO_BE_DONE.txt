in case of HB over SB, if there is a conflict over, say the last 30 min of a booking, should we cancel the whole timeslot? I think we shouldn't

if a (hard) booking is made from a certain hour to another hour which doesn't match our timeslots, does that work? I think it should

#(in the template when we have the information)
need to make the display of the room with their capacity and location in the room_display section (we might want to discuss that)

#On Going PF
need to convert the timesheet given by the registrar's office into our DB

#maybe not so important or DB takes care of that
need to know what to do when two people book the room at the SAME time (and how to simulate that....)

#ask mcgill it
how can we send the emails without using our personal accounts

Make things pretty css

#django tutorial
two types of user (special for HB)

Give option to modify (reduce) a booking time slots

#there is a function 'flush_past_bookings' that can be used for that
Past bookings (before current date) needs to be removed

Give option to modify (reduce) a booking time slots

#ask the registrar
what is the maximum duration for a booking's timeslot

create a view
login through link to manage all bookings

# PF wrote a test for that
forbid one user to book multiple rooms at same time

not have the tick option for HB for simple users

view and template
when ticking a box with timeslots adjacent to the same booking, tick everything

search options:

you can't search if you don't provide at least the date

search by date only and it shows all rooms with their availability on that date in a list style like McGill library

search by date and timeslots and it will give you the rooms list that are available

you can filter the later by room capacity as well

you should be able to filter by building

(need to check that with registrar if they have that info in their DB)
search with features available in the room 

****HB user

search by user (with their email)
